          Spring is one of the four conventional temperate seasons, following
          winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions
          of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local
          climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern
          Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At
          the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately
          twelve hours long, with day length increasing and night length
          decreasing as the season progresses.

        <p class="season--about">
          Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after
          spring and before autumn. At the summer solstice, the days are longest
          and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as the season
          progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer
          varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer
          in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere,
          and vice versa.

        <p class="season--about">
          Autumn, also known as fall in American English and sometimes in
          Canadian English,[1] is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn
          marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern
          Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of
          daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools down
          considerably. One of its main features is the shedding of leaves from
          deciduous trees.

        <p class="season--about">
          Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones
          (winter does not occur in most of the tropical zone). It occurs after
          autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of
          the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun.
          Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and
          some use a definition based on weather. When it is winter in the
          Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice
          versa. In many regions, winter is associated with snow and freezing
          temperatures.
